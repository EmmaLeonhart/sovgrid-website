"""Thirty-minute data-lake intake for a cleanvibe project.

The first session schedules this for 30 minutes after it starts (see CLAUDE.md,
"Thirty-minute intake"). It runs once and does the mechanical part without
judgment, so the history is exact:

1. Commit everything in the repository as it is found: "the repository 30
   minutes in, before moving into data_lake/". This records where every file
   the user dropped in started out.
2. `git mv` each top-level file or directory that had never been committed
   (the user's drops, new directories), except the project's own files, into
   `data_lake/`, and commit that move on its own.
3. Print a report for the agent: the two commits, what moved where, the files
   now in `data_lake/`, how much the user has said in the chat so far and how
   long ago their last message was (from the transcripts in `sessions/`), and
   a verdict: stay in chat mode (with the time of the next Mode check) or
   start work mode.

It records `intake_at` in `.cleanvibe.json`. Later runs (the Mode check) commit
and move nothing; they print only the chat report and the verdict.
Stdlib only. Exit code 0 on success, 1 if a git step failed.
